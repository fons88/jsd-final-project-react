# Astronomy Pix App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Live URL: https://fons88.github.io/jsd-final-project-react/

The idea of this app is to let users search astronomy pictures of the day by NASA by specific date and by range of dates, and added favourite picture to Favourites.

### Some technical hurdles:
1. to learn how to use MUI and the properties of required components
2. storing likes in server, for next step. Currently just stored as variable in parent component.
3. I'm trying to find how to access function outside parent component, but I think I finally figured out how that worked.
--- 
I enjoyed the process of figuring out the logic of routing and how parent and children components communicate with one another through props. Without this project, I would not have such a good understanding of how React framework works.

I figured I haven't really used any new technology that's not been covered in class yet. But maybe Material UI that I'm using for this project. I sort of just knew about it like 3 days ago.

Next I'd like to learn more about MUI components and their usage, also built a web server for this app. 
And, for the next project I think I'd like to work on apps for kids



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
