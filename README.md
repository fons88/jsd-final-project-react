### The idea of this app is to let users search astronomy pictures of the day by NASA by specific date and by range of dates, and added favourite picture to Favourites.

### Some technical hurdles:
1. to learn how to use MUI and the properties of required components
2. storing likes in server, for next step. Currently just stored as variable in parent component.
3. I'm trying to find how to access function outside parent component, but I think I finally figured out how that worked.

I enjoyed the process of figuring out the logic of routing and how parent and children components communicate with one another through props. Without this project, I would not have such a good understanding of how React framework works.

I think I haven't really used any new technology that's not been covered in JSD class yet. But maybe Material UI that I'm using for this project. I sort of just knew about it like 3 days ago.

Next I'd like to learn more about MUI components and their usage, also built a web server for this app.
I'll be working on to improve things like adding comments feature and saving the favourites into a database.
I also would add the actual link to get news on Asteroid, menu is already there, but it's not working yet.
And, for the next project I think I'd like to work on apps for kids
